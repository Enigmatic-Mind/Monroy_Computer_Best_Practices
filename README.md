# ‚ùìWhat is Obsidian?
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful, free note-taking application with a lot of flexibility and customization options. Also, notes are stored locally!

# üîê What is the Monroy Computer Best Practices Vault?
Obsidian notes are organized within vaults, which can be thought of as root folders. Each vault can be uniquely customized to suit different workflows and preferences. The Monroy Computer Best Practices Vault is designed with a few main objectives: 1) to enhance productivity and efficiency with your computer through settings and applications, 2) file management guide, 3) backup guide, 4) encryption guide, and 5) password management guide.

This vault is the result of the process I have undergone to set up my own computer. The result is a guide that's not only highly functional but also practical and cuts through the fluff.

This project is not just a tool I use personally, but also a means to connect with and support others on similar journeys. I hope this vault provides as much value to you as it has to me.
