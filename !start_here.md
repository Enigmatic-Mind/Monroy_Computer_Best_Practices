# File Management
Effective file management is crucial for maintaining productivity and reducing digital clutter. Inspired by Thomas Frank's recommendations in his video, "[The Best Way to Organize Your Computer Files - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjRKZxr-KY)," this section outlines a practical approach to organizing your files systematically. Following these principles will help you navigate your digital environment more efficiently.
**Key Principles:**
1. Every file must be placed inside a specific folder, not in general folders like Downloads or Documents.
2. Be specific when naming your files, but not too specific.
3. Following an organizational strategy similar to a tree: 
	- All folders are placed in a root folder
	- Branch out in a logical manner, organizing:
	    - By category, for general organization.
	    - By date, when dealing with large volumes of files.

## Examples
- While there are many ways to structure your files, finding one that resonates with your workflow is key. For instance, the [GitHub - roboyoshi/datacurator-filetree](https://github.com/roboyoshi/datacurator-filetree) offers a structured approach, though it may not suit everyone's taste.

This step is a bit redundant with the next step, but the goal is to use standard manners of backing up your entire computer, such as Time Machine for MacOS, since the next step only transfers files and may not capture passwords, settings, etc. I did this step, but I have not needed to use my backups yet.
- [ ] **Transfer ALL Files to SSD/Cleanup Folder**: Create a dedicated space on an external SSD to temporarily hold all files during the transition.
    - [ ] **Thumb Drives**: Transfer all temporary files from thumb drives.
    - [ ] **Computer Files**: Move files from the computer, ensuring nothing important is left behind.
    - [ ] **Other Devices**: Gather files from other devices that need to be integrated into the new structure.
    - [ ] **Browser Passwords**: If you use browser auto-fill passwords, make sure to save those!
    - [ ] **Backup Settings, Autofill Information, and More**: It may be crucial to preserve settings, autofill data, and other configurations that are not directly tied to visible files but are essential for your digital experience. Take the time to:
	    - [ ] **Export Browser Data**: Save your autofill forms, passwords, and bookmarks from your web browser.
	    - [ ] **List Installed Applications**: Compile a comprehensive list of all applications installed on your device, highlighting those critical for your daily operations.
	    - [ ] **Document Special Configurations**: Note down any custom settings, drivers, or software configurations that were challenging to set up initially. This includes specific drivers that were difficult to source and configurations that optimize your workflow. Documenting these details will save time and frustration during the reinstallation process.
- [ ] **Factory Reset Computer**: Perform a factory reset on your computer to start fresh, improving performance and removing unnecessary clutter.
- [ ] **Download Core Apps and Set Up Using Saved Settings Files**: Reinstall core applications and configure them using previously saved settings for a seamless transition.
- [ ] **Create Folder Structure in Documents Directory**: Establish a new, organized folder structure within the Documents directory based on your planning and assessment.
- [ ] **Create Other Folder Structures**: Set up additional necessary structures on an SSD or in the Documents directory, such as:
    - [ ] **Archive**: For storing important historical and reference documents.
    - [ ] **Library**: For knowledge resources like books, articles, and links.
    - [ ] **Backups**: Designate a space for ongoing backup processes.
- [ ] **Organize Files in the Cleanup Folder of Your SSD**: Methodically sort files from the cleanup folder into their designated new locations.
    - [ ] **Projects**: Active and upcoming projects.
    - [ ] **Archive**: Important files that are not frequently accessed.
    - [ ] **Library**: Reference materials and resources.
    - [ ] **Someday Maybe**: Items of potential future interest or use.
    - [ ] **Trash**: Eliminate unnecessary files to free up space.
- [ ] **Review and Refine Folder Structure**: After the initial organization, review the folder structure for any needed adjustments or optimizations.
- [ ] **Implement Routine Maintenance**: Schedule regular reviews of your file organization to adjust and clean up as needed, ensuring the system remains effective over time.
- [ ] **Test Backup and Restore Processes**: Ensure that your backup system is functioning correctly by performing test backups and restores.

# Backup
nvesting time and effort into setting up your computer system makes it crucial to consider robust backup solutions. The risk of data loss due to hardware failure, theft, or accidental damage is real and can result in significant setbacks. To safeguard against such eventualities, implementing a dual backup strategy combining local and cloud-based solutions is essential. This approach ensures your data is protected in multiple locations, providing peace of mind and facilitating quick recovery when needed.

Here's a breakdown of the backup strategies I recommend and personally use.

## Cloud-Based Backup
Cloud backups offer off-site protection, ensuring your data remains safe even in the event of physical damage to your local environment. My experience with various services led me to prefer the following:
- [Backblaze - The Best Unlimited Cloud Storage Services](https://www.backblaze.com/): After exploring numerous options, I settled on Backblaze for its unlimited storage capacity and ease of use. I opted for the one-year plan to evaluate its performance. The initial backup of my Mac and SSD took between 3-5 days, but subsequent backups became automatic and much quicker, often completed in under 30 minutes nightly. With my internet connection, Backblaze achieves speeds of approximately 320 GB/day.

A good review of cloud-based backup options that I referred to to make my decision: [Best Online Cloud Backup | Backblaze vs iDrive vs Carbonite vs Crashplan - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn8hbF5nSRw&t=1125s).
I'd recommend searching further if you prefer many options. Personally, I'd probably follow this guide in the future:
- [How to back up data privately and securely to the cloud using Borg and Vorta - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asZX2YbTaNE)

## Local Backup Options
For local backups, which I perform weekly, I rely on Time Machine for MacOS.
- [[Time Machine]] (for MacOS)

By employing both local and cloud-based backups, I enjoy a comprehensive protection scheme that covers all bases. Local backups offer immediate, easy access to restore points, while cloud backups provide an additional layer of security by storing data off-site. Together, these strategies form a robust defense against data loss, ensuring that your digital life is well-protected against unforeseen events.

# Encryption
In our digital lives, we often handle sensitive information ranging from personal identity documents to confidential files. To safeguard this data against unauthorized access, especially when storing it on SSDs or uploading to cloud services, adopting robust encryption practices is essential. Encryption acts as a vital security layer, ensuring that your data remains private and secure, accessible only to those who possess the correct decryption key.

As I navigate the process of enhancing my data security, I'll be leveraging detailed guides that outline effective encryption techniques. These resources are invaluable for anyone looking to secure their digital information:
- **[How to back up and encrypt data using rsync and VeraCrypt on macOS (see change log) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cz_ViFB6eE)**: This video tutorial provides a comprehensive walkthrough on using rsync for backups and VeraCrypt for encryption, specifically tailored for macOS users. It's an excellent starting point for those unfamiliar with encryption tools and processes.
- **[How to back up and encrypt data using rsync and VeraCrypt on macOS — Sun Knudsen](https://sunknudsen.com/privacy-guides/how-to-back-up-and-encrypt-data-using-rsync-and-veracrypt-on-macos)**: Sun Knudsen's privacy guide complements the video with a detailed, step-by-step written tutorial. It covers the intricacies of setting up encrypted backups, making it a valuable resource for ensuring your data's security.

In the coming weeks, as I implement these encryption practices, I encourage you to consider doing the same. Securing our personal and sensitive files is not just a precaution; it's a necessary step in protecting our digital footprint and maintaining privacy in an increasingly connected world.
# Password Management
In our journey towards securing our digital identity, the implementation of a robust password management strategy cannot be overstated. The advice from Sun Knudsen has been instrumental in highlighting the necessity of a password manager in our cybersecurity toolkit. Adhering to best practices for password security means creating a unique, complex password for each account. However, the challenge of remembering numerous complex passwords often leads us to compromise on security, either by reusing passwords across different sites or relying on browsers' autofill features. Both practices expose us to significant risks.

Password managers are the solution to this dilemma. They enable you to generate and store strong, unique passwords for every account, all of which are accessible behind one master password. This approach not only bolsters your online security but also simplifies the login process across websites and services.

As I navigate the setup of my own password management system, I've found the following resources invaluable for understanding the importance of this practice and choosing the right tool for the job:
- **[Why 1Password is the best proprietary password manager - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu3iP1njMRI)**: This video makes a compelling case for 1Password, detailing its features and why it stands out as a leading option in password management.
- **[How to Choose a Password - Computerphile - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjQ9b3pgIg)**: For those interested in the science of strong passwords, Computerphile breaks down the essentials of what makes a password secure.
- **[Hacker Teaches How to Manage Passwords - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3lRI9LRcmQ)**: Offering a hacker's perspective, this video provides practical advice on managing passwords effectively to protect against common cyber threats.

In the coming days, as I further develop my password management strategy, I encourage you to explore these resources and consider how a password manager could enhance your online security. Remember, the strength of your passwords is the foundation of your digital security. Investing in a password manager is not just about convenience; it's a critical step in safeguarding your digital life against unauthorized access.
